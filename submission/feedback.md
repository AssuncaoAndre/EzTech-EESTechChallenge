# Feedback for Infineon

This document presents the feedback from EzTech to Infinion regarding the task proposed for EESTech Challenge


## What was good
    * The challenge itself is very interesting. It has a unique objective and we need to collect and process our own data instead of using data from a random dataset. 
    * The presence of specialists throughout the competition is definetily a plus. We can ask questions and get a professional answer with no delay. The presence of the specialists was also important to better understand the radar.
    * The opening session presentation was very insightful to understand the work of the company and it was good to kick-off the networking session. 


## What can be improved
    * There was a lack of space for testing and we all shared the same testing area. This led to some problems acquiring data and made the whole process very time demanding.
    * The team from Aachen had a slight advantage in beggining phase of the competition because they had a challenge in the local round very similar to the present one. There is a feeling that at the start of the competition, they already understood the data and how to use the radar.
    * We believe that announcing the task the day before the competition damaged the social moments during that day. The attendance from the participants was low because the majority were already looking into information about the radar, reading papers, thinking about solutions, etc.

## General comment
Overall, Infieon's presence at EESTech Challenge Final is, by no doubts, amazing. It creates a good synergy between participants, organisers and the company. Nonetheless, we believe that some minor details could have been better.

We are very proud we made it this far and want to thank Infineon and LC Milan for the ownderful competition.
